# Build A web application with Starlette And Python

This is the code where I walk you through how to build a simple web application with Starlette.
`

- Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv env`
- Activate the virtual environment with ` source env/bin/activate` or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows

- Install all project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt `
- On Unix, you can simply run the shell script. `./run.sh`
- Or manually run `python -m uvicorn main:app`
